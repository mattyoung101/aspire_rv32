## Emulation
This directory contains the C++ emulation for the processor. There are two emulators: the Baseline Emulator,
which is an ISA-level model built on top of [libriscv](https://github.com/fwsGonzo/libriscv); and the
Verilator emulator, which is a cycle-accurate model of the SystemVerilog RTL generated by Verilator.

This is used for verification by differential fuzzing. Instructions are run through the Verilator model, whose
register file is compared against the reference model.

### Building and running
Requires CMake 3.20+, Clang, Ninja, LLD and spdlog which can be installed using your package manager.
librscv is fetched automatically by CMake.

Build:

```
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  # or Release
cd build
ninja
```

Run by specifying the path to the .bin file you want to simulate (note this is not an ELF file, it's the
result of that after objcopy):

```
./baseline_emulator <PATH_TO_BIN>
```
