## RISC-V CPU design thesis project for Semester 2 2024

Hi John,

My name is Matt Young, and I will be graduating from the Bachelor of Computer Science program here at UQ next
semester. I am considering pursuing an honours degree in computer science, which involves a research 
thesis. I'm reaching out to you as a potential supervisor because I feel your research interests align with
this project.

My proposed thesis consists of designing a simple 32-bit RISC-V CPU, implemented using SystemVerilog, on a
Lattice ECP5 FPGA. I've attached my proposal as a PDF to this email. It contains all the information about design 
goals, the verification plan, some details about the planned microarchitecture and benchmarks that will be 
performed on the finished design to measure its performance.

If you have the time available, and are interested in my proposal, your involvement as a supervisor for this
project would be very much appreciated. Given your experience at Xilinx and porting the Linux kernel to
MicroBlaze, you would be a fantastic supervisor and I would definitely learn a lot from your skillset.

If you are interested in this project, I would be very keen to set up a meeting whenever you are available
to discuss the topic further, to hear your thoughts on the project, and possibly how we might proceed.

Thanks for your consideration,
Matt.
